# MIS530-Create-a-Predictive-Model-Claims

For this CT Assignment, using SAS Enterprise Miner you will use a dataset named Claims to create a new project with one of the predictive analytic models covered in this course. The Claims dataset is available in your library once you create a New Library linking to the course data.

See the Library Connection instructions.

After creating the diagram, submit screenshots and a one-page summary in a Word document describing how you created this model to analyze this dataset. Describe the steps taken and the property changes necessary. The screenshots will be of the finalized diagram and the results screen of the model in SAS Enterprise Miner. Make sure your screenshot shows the whole diagram.
